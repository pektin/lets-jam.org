The Jam Language Reference
##########################

The Jam Language Reference describes the syntax, grammar and compilation of Jam.

It is supposed to provide a comprehensive language reference that acts as a goal
for the current implementation(s) of Jam.

Each section will feature a worded description, a formal syntax definition and
where possible, coded examples to demonstrate a feature in Jam.

.. note::
    This is currently a work in progress is highly subject to change.
