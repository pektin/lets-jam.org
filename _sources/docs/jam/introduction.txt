Introduction
############

This section is supposed to provide a comprehensive language reference that
acts as a goal for the current implementation(s) of Jam.

Jam is a language frontend that translates to Lekvar, which can then be compiled
or interpreted by the backend.

Each section will feature a worded description, a formal syntax definition and
where possible, coded examples to demonstrate that feature in Jam syntax.

.. note::
    This is currently a work in progress is highly subject to change and is
    definitely not yet comprehensive.
