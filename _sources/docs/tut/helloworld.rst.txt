Hello World
###########

The standard "Hello World" program is easy to write in jam.

::

    # This is a comment and is ignored by the compiler

    # Any top-level instructions are run immediately by jam
    # This line prints 'Hello World!' to the console
    puts("Hello World!")

In this example, ``puts`` is a builtin method that prints a string, such as
``Hello World!``, to the console.
