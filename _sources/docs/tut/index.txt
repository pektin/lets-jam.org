Introduction
============

This tutorial serves as a guide for those new to the language and its tools. For
more detailed and technical description of the language and its library please
refer to the :doc:`language reference<../jam/index>` and the
:doc:`library reference<../lib/index>`.

Each section will feature worded descriptions of language features alongside
easy to understand, practical examples of common usage of these features. It is
recommended that the tutorial be followed sequentially.

.. note::
    This is currently a work in progress and is highly subject to change. It is
    definitely not yet comprehensive.

Installing
==========

Currently Jam is only provided as a python module. In order to install the Jam
compiler tool clone the source repository from Github_. Once downloaded, run
``make install`` to symlink all tools into your ``/usr/bin`` directory.
