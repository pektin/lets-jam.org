About Jam
#########

Concept
=======

Jam is an attempt to bridge the gap between dynamic, interpreted languages and
static compiles ones.

Effectively most useful language constructs from languages such as Ruby_ and
Python_ can be statically verified and compiled to something as natively
efficient as if the equivalent were written in languages such as C++ or D_.

Because of this, it is possible to combine a lot of the type safety and other
neat features from static compiled languages with the dynamic nature common to
interpreted ones. This includes types as values, monkey-patching and effective
duck-typing.

Syntax
======

Jam syntax is heavily inspired by Ruby_ with a hint of Python_ and D_, designed
with readability and writeability in mind.
