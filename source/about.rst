About Jam
#########

Jam is the result of a theory: That all code written in dynamic programming
languages such as Ruby_ and Python_ can be efficiently translated to equivalent
code in a non-dynamic language such as C++ or D_ and thereby compiled. Jam is a
language that tries to emulate the high level dynamic nature of Ruby_ and
Python_ in a statically typed, compiled environment.

Syntax
======

The syntax of Jam is heavily inspired by Ruby_ and Python_, with the occasional
hint of other languages. The syntax was designed after the type system and
builds upon it.
